    "# Issue with missing ion peaks\n",
    "For spectra with missing ions, we still want to be able to sequence them. With non-hybrid sequences, this really isn't that much of a problem, as hopefully the b ions make up for some of the missing y ions and vice versa. However, especially in the case of unbalanced ions. The picture kind of shows the issue\n",

    "In this case, there are enough b-ions to describe the left k-mer but not enough y-ions to describe the right k-mer. What we need to do is try new extensions after getting top scoring k-mers to try and describe the b-ions found all the way on the right"
